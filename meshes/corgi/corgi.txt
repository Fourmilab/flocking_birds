Edit original file:
    blender corgi_low_poly.blend

Delete corgi on the right:
    b, select with mouse, edit/delete
this deletes the background as well.

View/View all layers
    this shows the second model with the base.

Select right side of base with b+mouse, Edit/delete to delete.

Now we have just the corgi.

Save as: corgi1.blend

Colouring of the model is done wiht materials: go to Properties/
Materials (sphere icon) to see definitions.

Deleted armature, camera, and light.

Save as corgi2.blend.

Exported as DAE, re-imported, exported again.  Same problem.

After an hour flailing around, I figured out that the problem was
that the normals for the sections which were being imported as
transparent were backward.  To fix this in Blender:
    Click in the 3D window, then tab until at the left Shading/UVs
        appears as a tab, select the tab.
    Right mouse select the entire mesh.
    Click Normals/Recalculate.
Save the updated file.  You should now be able to import the
DAE and everything will be visible and your materials applied.

Saved this version as xorgi5.blend.

Resaved xorgi6.blend, exported xorgi6.dae.
